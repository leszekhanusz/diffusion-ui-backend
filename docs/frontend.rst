Frontend
========

Installing the frontend is not necessary as it is available on http://diffusionui.com
but you might want to do it either to make some modifications to the code or to run
the website completely offline.

To install the frontend, install `node.js`_, clone this repo and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    npm install

Then to get a local web page, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    npm run dev

.. _node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download
