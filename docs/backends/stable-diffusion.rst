Stable Diffusion
================

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Linux

        - Install conda if it is not already installed

        - Create an environment named **dui**:

        .. code-block:: bash

            conda create -n dui python=3.10

        - Activate that environment (You will need to do that every time before running the backend):

        .. code-block:: bash

            conda activate dui

        - You now should have a **(dui)** text in front of your prompt indicating that you are inside that environment.

        - Inside this environment, install `pytorch <https://pytorch.org>`_ with cuda support:

        .. code-block:: bash

            conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.6 -c pytorch -c conda-forge

        - Install the diffusionui backend and its dependencies:

        .. code-block:: bash

            pip install diffusionui

    .. tab:: Windows

        - Download `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_
        - Install Miniconda. Install for all users. Uncheck "Register Miniconda as the system Python 3.9" unless you want to
        - `Activate Developer mode <https://www.wikihow.com/Enable-Developer-Mode-in-Windows-10>`_
        - Open Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)
        - Create an environment named **dui**:

        .. code-block:: bash

            conda create -n dui python=3.10

        - Activate that environment (You will need to do that every time before running the backend):

        .. code-block:: bash

            conda activate dui

        - You now should have a **(dui)** text in front of your prompt indicating that you are inside that environment.

        - Install `pytorch <https://pytorch.org>`_ with cuda support:

        .. code-block:: bash

            conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.6 -c pytorch -c conda-forge

        - Install the diffusionui backend and its dependencies:

        .. code-block:: bash

            pip install diffusionui

First Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first time, you have to download the model:

- create an account on https://huggingface.co
- `Click on this page to accept the LICENSE <https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4>`_
- `generate a token in your settings <https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens>`_
- login on your console with `huggingface-cli login`
- then download the model with:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Low VRAM (recommended)

        .. code-block:: bash

            diffusionui --low-mem --download-model

    .. tab:: High VRAM

        .. code-block:: bash

            diffusionui --download-model


Usage
^^^^^

Once the installation has been done, you should have a **diffusionui**
executable in the **dui** environment you created.

Every time you need to run the backend, don't forget to activate that environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate dui

You can check the current installed version by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

    diffusionui --version

To start the backend, run:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Low VRAM (recommended)

        .. code-block:: bash

            diffusionui --low-mem

    .. tab:: High VRAM

        .. code-block:: bash

            diffusionui

It should produce an local URL for the gradio interface:

.. code-block:: bash

    Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860/


.. warning::

    The port number at the end of the url should be 7860.
    Sometimes if you stop the program and start it again shortly after,
    then the port number will change to 7861.

    If that happens, simply try again until the port number is 7860 once again.

Once you have this local URL, congratulations ðŸš€ !
You can now visit https://diffusionui.com to access it with the nice interface.
