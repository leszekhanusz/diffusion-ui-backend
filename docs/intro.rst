Introduction
============

`Diffusion-UI`_ is a web frontend to generate images using latent diffusion models.

Thanks to `Stable Diffusion`_ which `released their model for free on August 22, 2022`_,
it is now possible to generate amazing images, from text or from another image,
for free, on your own computer.

DiffusionUI is available on http://diffusionui.com, but to use the Stable Diffusion model
you have to install the Stable Diffusion backend on your own computer.

Absolutely no data is received on our servers when you are using http://diffusionui.com
with a local backend and you can even use it offline once the website has been loaded.

Requirements
------------

- 16GB RAM
- Maxwell-architecture or newer GPU with at least 4GB VRAM
